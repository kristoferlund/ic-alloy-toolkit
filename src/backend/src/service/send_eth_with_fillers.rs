/// This function will attempt to send 100 wei to the ethereum address of the canister.
///
/// Transfer some SepoliaEth to the canister address before calling this function.
///
/// Using `with_recommended_fillers` with the provider means the following RPC functions
/// will be called before transaction is made:
/// - `eth_getTransactionCount`: To determine the nonce of the Transction
/// - `eth_chainId`: To determine the chain id
/// - `eth_feeHistory`: To determine historic gas price
/// - `eth_estimateGas`: To determine the gas limit
/// - `eth_sendRawTransaction`: The transaction
/// - `eth_getTransactionByHash`: To determine if transaction was successful. Increment nonce only
/// if transaction was successful.
///
/// Using `with_recommended_fillers` is only recommended if you use a deduplication proxy between
/// the EVM RPC canister and the RPC service (Alchemy, etc). When making an EVM RPC call on IC,
/// that call is executed by all the nodes in the subnet, currently 34 on the subnet where the
/// EVM RPC canister resides. Usinf this example without a deduplication proxy would result in
/// 6 x 34 = 204 calls being made during the span of a few seconds. That most likely leads to the
/// ceiling of number of requests per second being hit and the RPC provider responding with an
/// error.
