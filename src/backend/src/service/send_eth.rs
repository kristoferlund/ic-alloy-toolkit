/// This function will attempt to send 100 wei to the ethereum address of the canister.
///
/// Transfer some SepoliaEth to the canister address before calling this function.
///
/// Nonce handling is implemented manually instead of relying on the Alloy built in
/// `with_recommended_fillers` method. This minimizes the number of requests sent to the
/// EVM RPC.
///
/// The following RPC calls are made to complete a transaction:
/// - `eth_getTransactionCount`: To determine the next nonce. This call is only made once after
/// canister deployment, then the nonces are cached.
/// - `eth_estimateGas`: To determine the gas limit
/// - `eth_sendRawTransaction`: The transaction
/// - `eth_getTransactionByHash`: To determine if transaction was successful. Increment nonce only
/// if transaction was successful.
///
/// Even though this function makes half as many RPC calls as `send_eth_with_fillers` it is still
/// recommended to use a deduplication proxy between the EVM RPC canister and the RPC provider
/// (Alchemy, etc). For a fully decentralised deployment, one option is also to deploy a copy of
/// the EVM RPC canister yourself on an app subnet with only 13 nodes and your own RPC API key.
/// Perhaps 3 calls * 13 = 39 fits within the RPC call limits.
